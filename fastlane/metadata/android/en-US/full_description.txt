The goal of Colección is to find sets of three cards that fulfill the requirements for a match as rapidly as possible.

There are 4 properties that define the image on each card:

Color - Each card has 1 of 4 possible colors:	
	    Blue, Orange, Green, and Red

Number - The number of shapes present on the card:
	    1, 2, or 3

Type - There are 4 kinds of shapes in the game:
	  Triangles, Parallelograms,
      Semicircles, and Rectangles

Fill - Each shape will have 1 of 3 patterns: 
	  Solid, Empty, or Grid

A Colección is a set where 3 cards either share the same characteristics, or have different, unique characteristics, for all 4 properties.

A Colección is not valid unless the requirements for ALL four properties are fulfilled!
